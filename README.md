# Music-Transcription using Deep-Neural-Networks

This project focuses on automating music transcription through deep learning. The goal is to translate raw audio into symbolic music representation (MIDI format) using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM).

The MIDI Aligned Piano Music (MAPS) dataset was used as the primary dataset, providing high-quality, aligned audio and MIDI pairs for training and evaluation.


  DNNs have been compared with LSTM networks. 8 Networks were build and trained in total : 

  - 4 DNNs: {1,2,3,4} layers and 256 units. 
  - 4 LSTMs: {1,2,3,4} layers and 256 units.
